/* Work Log: add your name in brackets, the date, and a brief summary of what you contributed that day.
The assignment details that code you wrote requires a comment with your name above it. We will implement
that using this process. Log your work up here, and if you make a revision to existing code then add your
name in a comment on the same line to not interfere with other important documentation requirements.

3/11    [chris]     - Created class, added work log comment.
